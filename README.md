### Full Stack Systems Engineer
*Building secure, scalable, and reliable architecture for the web.*

---

I don't just build frontends; I engineer complete systems.
My focus is on **Reliability Engineering**—creating applications that look great on the client side (Next.js/React) while remaining bulletproof on the server side. Whether it's high-frequency blockchain forensics or business-critical booking platforms, I build software that **does not fail**.

### 🔭 Current Focus: Vanguard Secure Solutions
**Vanguard Secure Solutions** is my architecture firm specialized in digitizing high-trust service businesses.

**The Flagship Implementation:**
> **[Project: The Kennel Platform (Pet Passport)](https://github.com/gammahazard/vanguard-frontend)**
> A Zero-Liability booking and identity platform built to manage luxury pet facilities.
> * **Concept:** Digital Identity ("Passport") & Biometric Access Control.
> * **Stack:** Next.js 14, Rust (Axum), FIDO2, SQLite.
> * **Innovation:** Client-side logic handles complex capacity planning without server latency.

### 🛠️ The Full Stack Arsenal

I operate across the entire stack, from pixel-perfect UI to memory-safe backend logic.

### 🧠 Engineering Philosophy
* **Decoupled by Default:** Vanguard utilizes a strict **Decoupled Architecture**. The Frontend (User Experience) and Backend (Business Logic) are separate entities. This ensures security isolation and allows components to scale independently.
* **Data Agnostic:** I select the right tool for the job—**SQL** (SQLite/Postgres) for relational integrity in financial systems, and **NoSQL** (MongoDB) for flexible schemas in gaming/social data.
* **The "WASI" Advantage:** I specialize in the **WASI Component Model** to build portable, secure backends that can run anywhere.

### 🕵️ On-Chain Forensics & Research
* **Incident Response:** Mitigating live threats and phishing vectors in the Metafrontier ecosystem and associated Solana protocols.
* **Transaction Analysis:** Specialized in tracing diverted funds and analyzing smart contract interactions on Solana/EVM.
