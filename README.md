### Systems Engineer
*Engineering high-assurance systems—from industrial edge devices to enterprise web.*

## 🖥️ Interactive Terminal Portfolio

> **[Launch Terminal System >>](https://gammahazard.github.io/Vanguard-Portfolio/)**
> *Built with Rust & WebAssembly.*

I don't just build frontends; I engineer complete systems.
My focus is on **Reliability Engineering**—creating applications that look great on the client side (Next.js/React) while remaining bulletproof on the server side. Whether it's high-frequency blockchain forensics, cross-platform desktop apps, or business-critical booking platforms, I build software designed to **fail gracefully and recover instantly**.

### 🧠 Engineering Philosophy

* **Deep Runtime Knowledge:** I understand the JavaScript runtime at a low level (ESM vs CJS, Event Loop, Bundling). I specialize in making legacy modules work within modern, strict frameworks like Next.js.

* **Zero-Liability Design:** I prioritize **risk reduction**. I leverage hardware security (FIDO2) and architectural air-gaps to ensure that toxic data (Credit Cards/PII) never touches the application database.

* **Capability-Based Security:** I design systems where untrusted code runs in sandboxes that can only access explicitly granted capabilities. Deny by default, grant by exception.

* **Crash Containment:** Untrusted parsers run in WASM sandboxes. A buffer overflow kills the sandbox—not the host. Sub-millisecond recovery, zero data loss.

* **Hitless Failover:** 2oo3 TMR voting ensures continuous operation during faults. WASM's microsecond instantiation enables software failover without frame loss.

* **WASM + Docker (The Hybrid Model):** I previously viewed WASM as a Docker replacement. I now architect systems where they coexist: Docker ships the *Infrastructure* (The Rust Host or Kernel), while WASM ships the *Business Logic* (The Plugins). This enables O(n) secure tenants within O(1) container, drastically reducing overhead/cost compared to "one container per tenant."

* **Real Measurements, Not Marketing:** When I claim "<0.1ms rebuild," I provide `performance.now()` timings (5-sample averaged) in the live demo. Evidence over assertions.
